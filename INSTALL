This program is currently tested on the uno and nano boards and
verified to work on either. If you have another board, it may work
or may require some adjustment depending on pin layout or other
factors. I'm using it on a Chinese clone without issues. 

There are at least three ways to install the program onto an Arduino.

If you use the Arduino IDE then just open AmpControls.ino with
the IDE and install as normal.

If you have the arduino-cli program installed and like doing it
all manually that is method two.

If you have the arduino-cli program installed, and you are running
some form of *nix, there is a Makefile present in the distribution
which will compile and upload to your board. First step is to find
out what board you have and get it's fqbn string plus the port it
is plugged into. Plug in your board and use the make target "list".

	% make list

Make will try to determine the correct board and port, and save the
information in config.mk. It is recommended to look over that file
and edit if neccessary before building. The build is then the
usual command when compiling from source.

	% make

To install (upload) onto your board:

	% make install
